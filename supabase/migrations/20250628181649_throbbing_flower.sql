/*
  # Fix infinite recursion in family_members RLS policies

  1. Policy Changes
    - Drop existing problematic policies that cause infinite recursion
    - Create new simplified policies that avoid self-referencing queries
    - Ensure policies reference other tables or use simpler conditions

  2. Security
    - Maintain the same security model but without circular references
    - Users can still manage their own memberships
    - Family creators can still manage all memberships
    - Admins can still manage other memberships through simplified logic

  3. Changes
    - Remove policies that query family_members within family_members policies
    - Use direct family ownership checks instead of role-based checks where possible
    - Simplify admin checks to avoid recursion
