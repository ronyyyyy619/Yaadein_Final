Yaadein 
Yaadein is a platform for families to preserve, organize, and share precious memories. It includes an AI-driven backend for analyzing and tagging photos, facial recognition, and interactive memory games. The platform also features a mobile app for iOS and Android, built with React, TypeScript, and Capacitor.

üéØ Project Overview
Yaadein is a robust memory management system powered by advanced AI models. The platform allows families to upload photos, videos, and audio recordings, collaborate on organizing and tagging memories, and engage in memory games. The backend handles intelligent photo tagging, facial recognition, and dynamic game sessions, while the frontend (web and mobile) provides a seamless user experience.
